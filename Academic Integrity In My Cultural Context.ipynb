      "In the traditional Chinese Confucius culture, a general belief as cited by <cite data-cite=\"alford1995steal\"></cite> is \"To Steal a Book Is an Elegant Offence\", which was first mentioned in a short story published in 1919 by the famous Chinese writer Lu Xun <cite data-cite=\"xun1969kong\"></cite>. This belief has led to the conflict between China and the western world in the business and academical world.\n",

      "In defensive of the culture, I would say traditional Chinese scholars were awared of the ownership of intellectual property, otherwise they would not need to find an excuse like above mentioned. The properties themselves had got more attentions than their owners. The most famous Chinese traditional books, although they all have an author, were mostly co-authorized by many unknown people over many many years. It seemed that this culture cared about spreading the knowledge and encourage inspiration instead of rewarding the individual or keeping secret. But the result is unfortunately that the China 100 years ago was far behind the western world in sciences. So the western academic system has been introduced to China."
