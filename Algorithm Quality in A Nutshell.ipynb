Because the time complexity of the algorithm could increase very fast as the amount it's dealing scales up. The time complexity of the algorithm is often identified by the **big-theta notation** like `\u0398(n2)` <cite data-cite=\"[p.226]brookshear1997computer\"></cite>, or **big-O notation** like `O(n)` <cite data-cite=\"wiki:bigo\"></cite>.\n",
