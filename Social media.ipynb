      "We wouldn't call the internal communication applications within a company \"social media\". For example, if a company uses Microsoft Lync as their internal point-to-point communication tool, and uses wiki as internal information sharing tool, we won't call them social medias. Social media is based on the Web2.0 technology, but it has an emphasize on a virtual community <cite data-cite=\"wiki:social\"></cite>. In the physical communities, or the society, laws and regulations have been formed and evolved for centuries. But the virtual community enabled by the new technology is still new. Although it's still a community formed by humans, but because of the technology there are quite a lot of differences. Some of the differences are never expected by the humans before.\n",

And it's also debateable that the government like the US and NGOs has been supporting social media to do so <cite data-cite=\"ghannam2011social\"></cite>. There are also nations that block their people to access the social media outside their nation. Users in those nations need to learn technology to bypass the blocking.
