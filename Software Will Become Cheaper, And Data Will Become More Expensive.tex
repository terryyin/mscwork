\setlength{\parskip}{0.5em}
  We pay the same amount of money but can always get more features from
the software than before. Software will become even cheaper in the
future if not completely free. On the other hand, the data we use to
feed the software will become the core assets and more expensive. This
article will try to verify this trend. It also discusses some of the
problems we will face when the software become very cheap and the data
become very expensive.

                \end{abstract}
                

    \section{The trend of computer science}


\setlength{\parskip}{0.5em}
  Computer Sciences was considered about machines and their peripheral
equipment. Edsger Dijkstra in his book \cite{dijkstra1986cultural} says:

\begin{quote}
The job {[}of operating or using a computer{]} was actually beyond the
electronic technology of the day, and, as a result, the question of how
to get and keep the physical equipment more or less in working condition
became in the early days the all-overriding concern. As a result, the
topic became ---primarily in the USA--- prematurely known as ``computer
science'' ---which, actually is like referring to surgery as ``knife
science''--- and it was firmly implanted in people's minds that
computing science is about machines and their peripheral equipment. Quod
non {[}Latin: ``Which is not true''{]}
\end{quote}

\setlength{\parskip}{0.5em}
  And now Computer Science is defined as ``the science of algorithms.''
\cite[p.10]{brookshear1997computer}

\setlength{\parskip}{0.5em}
  Perhaps, in the future Computer Science will move on to be ``the science
of data''.


    \section{Software Products Are Becoming Cheaper}


\setlength{\parskip}{0.5em}
  Software is getting cheaper. We pay the similar amount of money to get a
lot more powerful software than before. And the software will become
even cheaper.


    \subsection{The trend of open source software (and hardware)}


\setlength{\parskip}{0.5em}
  People are creating more and more open source software, and the rate of
open source software usage is also increasing \cite{opensource}.


    \subsection{Software are getting smarter and more around data}



    \subsection{Will cheap software hurts the industry?}


\setlength{\parskip}{0.5em}
  In an Internet company I've worked with (Dianping.com), although they
didn't open source their software, they don't really care much about
protecting it either. There's only one small piece of software that is
kept secret within just a few people, and that is the rule of ranking
their customers. If their customers know the ranking rules, they may
cheat. That software is rather just some very simple code, and we can
arguably say it's also data.


    \section{Data will become more expensive}



    \subsection{Data will become more useful}


\setlength{\parskip}{0.5em}
  As the advancing of computer technology, data will do better in
``speaking for themselves'' \cite{gould1981letting}.


    \subsection{Data is the core assets of companies and governments}



    \subsection{Data ethics}


\setlength{\parskip}{0.5em}
  When things are expensive things, there will be ethical problems.
\cite{richards2014big}
