On the other hand, the data we use to feed the software will become the core assets and more expensive. This article will try to verify this trend. It also discusses some of the problems we will face when the software become very cheap and the data become very expensive."

As a result, the topic became \u2014primarily in the USA\u2014 prematurely known as \"computer science\" \u2014which, actually is like referring to surgery as \"knife science\"\u2014 and it was firmly implanted in people's minds that computing science is about machines and their peripheral equipment.

There's only one small piece of software that is kept secret within just a few people, and that is the rule of ranking their customers. If their customers know the ranking rules, they may cheat. That software is rather just some very simple code, and we can arguably say it's also data."
