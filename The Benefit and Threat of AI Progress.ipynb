      "Autonomation, or Jidoka, is an \"intelligent automation\". It's invented by Sakichi Toyoda, the founder of the Toyota Group. He invented numerous weaving devices, including the automatic loom. In 1924, he invented the Type-G Toyoda Automatic Loom, which outperform all the other automatic looms. By the time, the automatic looms from other countries were already very fast. But Toyoda's loom has a unique feature. The loom stopped when a problem arose, and so that no defective products were produced. A human operator would need to come and fix the problem. A machine that knew when to stop, outperform the machine that didn't. (Story from <cite data-cite=\"liker2006toyota\"></cite>)"

The above mentioned loom is not an intelligent machine, it still takes an intelligent person to solve the problem. In computer sciences, people are trying very hard to give a machine the intelligence like human have, or even beyond human."

In some simple games, like Reversi, computer AI is already a lot better than the human players. In chess, computer AI just became better than human.

In more complicated areas other than gaming, e.g. translation and handwriting recognition, AI is still not as good as human."

If a computer outsources its handwriting reading job to a human, then it can achieve a lot more with its own strength in other areas."

With more solid founding theories and the emerging areas like data mining and machine learning, we are facing great opportunity and risk in the future to have another intelligent being side by side with the human beings."
