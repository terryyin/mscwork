My job was to develop and maintain the POSIX component. The OS wasn't POSIX compatible in the beginning. But later it became a problem, for example, it couldn't take the advantage of the free resources, like the TCP/IP stack implementation from FreeBSD. So POSIX interface needed to be introduced to the OS. It had been a very painful move since the legacy system was too different from Unix. The late introducing of POSIX also caused a lot of confusion for the other developers. For example, when they called a function `free()` to free the memory, they were not sure whether they were calling a POSIX function or the DMX native function.\n",
