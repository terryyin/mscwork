The color of the already put disks might change, but there's only adding, not removing. So the game will always end after at most 60 moves. Although the same state of the game could be achieved by different path of state changing, because the game will end in limited moves any way, we can just ignore the duplicated states. Then the state graph looks just like a tree."

This will need us to implement some heuristics, which represents the evaluation of a nodes which is not the end nodes <cite data-cite=\"[p.478]brookshear1997computer\"></cite>. In a chess-like game, the often used algorithm for an optimized searching is the minmax algorithm <cite data-cite=\"wiki:minmax\"></cite>, or it's simplified version, the negamax algorithm <cite data-cite=\"wiki:negamax\"></cite>."

Otherwise when people found their mobile device becomes very hot or the battery dies too fast when running your application, they will stop using it. For example, until now, using the AngularJS <cite data-cite=\"darwin2013angularjs\"></cite> to develop web based application for mobile is probably a bad idea. Because frameworks like AngularJS use too much resouce.\n",

But if you want find tuned UI, you will need to have specific design for each screen size.\n",

It make sharing solutions between these platforms very hard. But there's still something we can do to make the situation better. The different platforms could at least share the same set of tests. Testing tools like Calabash (http://calaba.sh) makes it possible to do cross platform testing. So you run the automated test once and run it on every devices. There's also open source project like the \"mobile chrome apps\"(https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/mobile-chrome-apps) project trying to make it possible to create the apps once and run it on both iOS and Android.\n",

      "**Memory and CPU limitation** The limitation is becoming already a lot better. Some phones already have 4G memory. But still, a mobile device doesn't have advantage in computing reources. So when possible, we want to keep the computing job on the server side. And because some mobile apps are continuously on the device just like an embedded software, the developer also need to pay extra attention to the accumulative resource consumption. For example, a little memory leak in the app might create big trouble if it has been runing for days on the mobile device."
