      "The `<frame>` tag in the early version of HTML was an attempt to separate the concerns on the web page <cite data-cite=\"html-frame\"></cite>. It divides a single web page window into several areas (which is collectively under a `<frameset>` tag). Each of of these areas, or frames, only provide part of the information, e.g. the navigation menu, the sidebar and the main content. Put it in another word, the `<frame>` tag was a try of decoupling.
