They should be able to deliver quickly to any environment so that they are not limited by any vendor. Their ability to scale the service is also crucial to the small business. It will be a truly sadly story if their business opportunity suddenly shows up, but they cannot scale up to provide the service.

When one role is the centralized server, and another role is the client that request service from the server, we got a client/server model. There are other models when assigning responsibilities differently over the horizontal level. Usually, C/S model is simple and clear, but it cannot fulfill the need for highly dynamic distributed needs or high availability.\n",
