      "Two NBA teams in Los Angeles, the Lakers and the Clippers, both use the Staples Center as their home stadium. The Staples Center is also the home to the Los Angeles Kings and the Los Angeles Avengers, which are ice hockey team and arena football team respectively <cite data-cite=\"wiki:staples\"></cite>. So the stadium will need to change the floor to a basketball court, an ice hockey court or an arena football court frequently. Sharing stadium is a common pattern in professional sports. The teams do not need to care about the courts (most of the time). They just use them and play the games. Kobe Bryant doesn't know how to change the floor. He only knows how to win the games. The setup of the stadium is taken care by another party.\n",

These patterns are so common that when you learn to play basketball, most of the time you learn these patterns rather than the rules. For example, the **Crossover Dribble Technique** is just one of the infinite ways of dribbling within the rules. But since it's so useful and effective, people **gave it a name**. And because it has a name, now we can talk about it and teach it. There are also patterns involving more than one roles, e.g. the **pick and roll** and maybe the **triangle offense**."
